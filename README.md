# DWM1000-Dev-Board
This is a DWM1000 Dev-Board based on an ATmega328P, it works with 3.3V witch clock frequency of 8MHz, this board is power only via the USB port and exchange Serial data like the Arduino because of the USB/UART IC (CH340G) on board, the MCU should have a bootloader burnt on it via the ICSP connector on board, you can upload the Bootloader using the project minicore here is the link (https://github.com/MCUdude/MiniCore) with the current parameters (Board: ATmega328, Variant: 328P / 328A, Clock: External 8 MHZ, Bootloader Yes (UART0)).
